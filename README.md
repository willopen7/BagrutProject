This game features an exploratory action adventure with puzzle-solving and resource management elements. The player plays in two ways: the usual keyboard and mouse adventurer game, in which you open chests, find unique items, and progress through a series of riddles, and also using a headset that reads the userâ€™s brain waves and translates them into focus and calm levels. The player is rewarded for remaining focused and relaxed, which helps people train these abilities. The game is played on a grid, and every time you press one of the arrow keys you move one block to that direction.

The map objects that you can currently encounter are:  
**Box** - When nearby, gives you an item or some money.  
**Store** - You can buy all the items you need by pressing **1-6** on your keyboard.  
**Gate** - This can only be opened if you have a key.  
**Portal** - Transports you to another location.  
**Fountain** - Gives you money based on the current levels of calm and focus.  
**Monk** - Will let you be close to him only if you are calm enough.  
**Walls** - Keep you from falling off the map.  

The items that are currently in the game are:  
**Shoes** - make the duration between moves shorter, enabling you to go faster.  
**A map** - To use press **m**. This enlarges your sight for a short period, making you see further.  
**A key** - Used to open gates.  
**A compass** - To use press **c**. This reveals where the closest box is.  
**Focus & Calm potions** - To use press **1** or **2**. This boosts your focus or calm for a short period.
